## ✅ Tips to Stay on Track

- Use **LeetCode tag filters** like `"array"`, `"hashing"`, `"easy"` to focus
- For SQL50: **LeetCode SQL** is harder than SQLBolt — allow more time if stuck
- Maintain a **mistake log** to track what you misunderstood and how you fixed it
- Every 7 days, try to **explain one concept** to yourself or someone else
